### Life

_Hi, I'm Anish_

This is my blog.

So, I've been waiting to write about life. 

I like being alone. Not alone in a solitude way but I'm quite narcistic in that I want to delete people whenever I can and summon them too. 

First thing, I don't like social media. I've had instagram and deleted it for the reasons that only make sense to me. I've had twitter till very recently and deleted that too in a whim. 
One of the main reasons for this my desire to stay away from others. 

I like very few people. So few that I can count them on one hand. When I like them I like them more than I like myself.

I think I've come to understand life a lot more recently. I know that life has no definite meaning to understand except from our perspectives of it. But, in general when I think about life, some things are quite clear for me just from my experience of living.

We have so less time. I mean we think we have time to do everything we want in life but as age progresses, time just slips away at an accelerated pace.
Very few moments in life held significance when we ponder back to ourselves in the past. 

One very important thing I've learned recently is that life doesn't have a closure. We can't monologue ourselves into death. _We are just gone_.
We can't really acquire closure among our relationships. 

I took this knowledge and applied to life in general. Say, you are in a relationship and either of you choose to end it. Here after this thought, there is no _after_ for this relationship. The things you've always wanted to do with them, the stuff you've fantasized about at night before going to sleep are never going to be fulfilled and are going to be fantasies. This thought is terrifying for me.

The fact that nothing in life has a closure. So, what do we live for?

People rarely choose to love with reason. There are going to be the ones who loved them more than anyone and still get ignored for there inherent flaws. Which mind you aren't in their control. For example, facial symmetry. We all know that this is attractive and quite desirable. The same action performed by the one with objective attractiveness is going to be recognised more. This is a fact of life. 

This idea of closure is quite similar to [perfectionism](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/882657-you-know-the-whole-thing-about-perfectionism-the-perfectionism-is).

Nothing in life can be objectively perfect. No one has ever lived a perfect life. It's a curse to live a perfect life for perfection is one's perception of ideal. So, there is no room for the **_extraordinary_** - either good or bad.

Another reason for exiting social media is to do with authenticity. I'm quite an enthusiastic guy. Anything I pursue, I go head over heels. So, social media isn't an exception. One thing I've observed is my obsession with the percieved notions of myself. The urge to be liked and fitted in. This is so unlike me. I don't want to live for others. But on the other hand, in my experience when I look back I only remember the times I've spent with others. Why is this? Is being able to recall a good measurement for a time well spent? Can we have a great time and not remember anything at all?
