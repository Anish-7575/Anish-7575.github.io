## Life

_Hi, I'm Anish_

This is my blog.

So, I've been waiting to write about life. 

I like being alone. Not alone in a solitude way but I'm quite narcistic in that I want to delete people whenever I can and summon them too. 

First thing, I don't like social media. I've had instagram and deleted it for the reasons that only make sense to me. I've had twitter till very recently and deleted that too in a whim. 
One of the main reasons for this my desire to stay away from others. 

I like very few people. So few that I can count them on one hand. When I like them I like them more than I like myself.
